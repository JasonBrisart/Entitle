"""Fresh operating-system entropy for BSR2 envelope diversification.

The custom BSR2 DRBG is deterministic. This module adds an independent,
non-deterministic input at each encryption so a recreated DRBG state does not,
by itself, recreate the envelope salt and nonce.

This module uses only the Python standard library, but the entropy is supplied
by the operating system through secrets.token_bytes. It is intentionally not a
custom entropy source.
