"""
Entitle BSR Adapter

Connects Entitle to BrisartSecurityResearch (BSR2).

Expected behavior:
    - Entitle creates plain JSON entitlement payloads.
    - BSR encrypts/authenticates them into protected envelopes.
    - BSR verifies authentication before returning plaintext.
    - If BSR verification fails, Entitle denies governed rights.

Important:
    BrisartSecurityResearch is currently an experimental research implementation.
    Use this adapter for controlled, offline, internal, and research-oriented
    environments unless/until BSR receives independent review.

BSR2 itself lives in the sibling `bsr/` directory and is used completely
unmodified. Its own modules use flat, top-level imports
(e.g. `from brisart_security_primitives import ...`), so the `bsr/`
directory itself must be present on `sys.path` before this module is
imported. `entitle.bootstrap.ensure_bsr_on_path()` handles that; every
Entitle entry point (CLI, GUI, examples) calls it before importing anything
from this module.
